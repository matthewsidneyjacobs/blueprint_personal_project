    <p>Hello NOELLE. I wanted to share with you my idea for a personal project. Hopefully this website will persaude you to believe that I have put some effort into the preperations needed for a succesful project. I expect to change this at least a few times as I'm working- I think of this more as a starting point than an actual blueprint. Please feel free to look around, and if you have comments or suggestions I would like to hear them.</p>
    <p>Thank you, <br/> sid </p>
